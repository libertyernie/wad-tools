wad-tools
=========

A fork of BFGR WadTools v0.39a with some small tweaks.

Original source code provided here: https://github.com/libertyernie/wad-tools/issues/1

This branch is based on the code from the zip file in the aforementioned
GitHub issue, and does not include other changes like the main branch does.
The only changes that have been made were necessary to get it to run on:

* Windows
* C++
* .NET Framework (C++/CLI) without openssl dependency
